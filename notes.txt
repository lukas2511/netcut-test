=== Preview Source Files ===

Generated from capture files while still recording, extremely fast conversion using hardware acceleration / VAAPI,
1:1 naming from original capture files

see scripts/script-A-generate-previews.py

=== HLS Snippets/Playlist ===

ffmpeg can generate HLS snippet and the playlist, script uses same syntax as fuse-ts and generates a preview directory
with the corresponding playlist

see scripts/script-B-post-mount.py

=== Player ===

uses playlist in video.js, decoding of timestamps over the whole playlist is unreliable (because of that the UI glitches a bit),
while playing the timestamps from the actual files are used and will therefore be precise

the player uses videojs plugins for markers and hotkeys, actually setting the markers is currently done by really bad javascript
(remember: this is just a proof of concept player)
